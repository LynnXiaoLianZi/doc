<span id="plasticmodel"></span><h1>Plastic Model Group</h1>
<p>All plastic models potentially involve some degree of permanent, path-dependent
deformations (failure)—a consequence of the nonlinearity of the stress-strain relations.
The different models are characterized by their yield function,
hardening/softening functions, and flow rule. The yield functions for each model define the
stress combination for which plastic flow takes place. These functions or criteria are
represented by one or more limiting surfaces in a generalized stress space, with points
below or on the surface being characterized by an incremental elastic or plastic behavior,
respectively. The plastic flow formulation rests on basic assumptions from
plasticity theory that the total strain increment may be decomposed into elastic and
plastic parts, with only the elastic part contributing to the stress increment by means of
an elastic law (see the discussion in <a class="reference internal" href="formulation.html#inc-eqs-of-pf"><span class="std std-ref">Incremental Equations of the Theory of Plastic Flow</span></a>). In addition, both plastic
and elastic strain increments are taken to be coaxial with the current principal axes of
the stresses (only valid if elastic strains are small compared to plastic strains during
plastic flow). The flow rule specifies the direction of the plastic strain increment
vector as that normal to the potential surface; it is called associated if the potential
and yield functions coincide, and nonassociated otherwise. See Vermeer and de Borst (1984)
for a more detailed discussion on the theory of plasticity.</p>
<p>For the Drucker-Prager, Mohr-Coulomb, ubiquitous-joint, strain-hardening/softening, and
bilinear-hardening/softening-ubiquitous-joint models, a shear yield function and a
nonassociated shear flow rule are used. For the double-yield and CYSoil models, shear and
volumetric yield functions, nonassociated shear flow and associated volumetric flow rules
are included. The CHSoil model is a simplified version of the CYSoil model that provides
built-in friction hardening and dilation hardening/softening laws, and does not include a
volumetric cap. In addition, the failure envelope for each of the above models is
characterized by a tensile yield function with associated flow rule.</p>
<p>The modified Cam-clay model formulation rests on a combined shear and volumetric yield
function and associated flow rule.</p>
<p>The two types of Hoek-Brown model provide different formulations to represent
yielding. The basic Hoek-Brown model using a nonlinear shear yield function and a
plasticity flow rule that varies as a function of the stress level is referred to as the
Hoek-Brown-PAC model. For the traditional Hoek-Brown model, plastic flow is handled in a
manner similar to that in the Mohr-Coulomb model in which a dilation angle is specified.
Also, a tensile yield function similar to that used with the Mohr-Coulomb model is
included with the Hoek-Brown model.</p>
<p>Note also that all plasticity models are formulated in terms of <em>effective</em> stresses, <em>not</em> total stresses.</p>
<p>The plasticity models can produce localization (i.e., the development of families of
discontinuities such as shear bands in a material that starts as a continuum). Note that
localization is grid-dependent since there is no intrinsic length scale incorporated in
the formulations. This is an important consideration when creating a grid for a
plasticity analysis, and is discussed more fully in <a class="reference internal" href="../../methodology/localizationandpath.html#pathdependence"><span class="std std-ref">Localization, Physical Instability and Path-Dependence</span></a>.</p>
<p>As discussed in <a class="reference internal" href="formulation.html#cms-implementation"><span class="std std-ref">Implementation</span></a>, in the numerical implementation of the models, an
<em>elastic trial</em> (or “elastic guess”) for the stress increment is first computed
from the total strain increment using the incremental form of Hooke’s law. The
corresponding stresses are then evaluated. If they violate the yield criteria (i.e., the
stress-point representation lies above the yield function in the generalized stress
space), plastic deformations take place. In this case, only the elastic part of the strain
increment can contribute to the stress increment; the latter is corrected by using the
plastic flow rule to ensure that the stresses lie on the composite yield function. This
section describes the yield and potential functions, flow rules, and stress corrections for
the different plasticity models.</p>
